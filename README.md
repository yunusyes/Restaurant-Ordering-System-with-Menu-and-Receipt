# Restaurant-Ordering-System-with-Menu-and-Receipt


This program serves as a simple restaurant ordering system. It displays a menu of food and drink items with their prices, allowing customers to select items to order. Users can add multiple items to their order until they decide to quit the ordering process. Once they finish, the program generates a receipt that lists the items ordered and the total amount due.
